# Lil' Shortener

## Overview
This is a fun and speedy URL shortening application that utilizes Bitly's API. It's a simple single page application that utilizes some great aspects of the Vue framework to keep things from getting too bulky, code-wise. A user can enter any URL, click on the button next to the input, and receive a shortened version of their URL input. The application only accepts valid https:// addresses and reminds the user if they put in an inappropriate link format or try to submit an empty form. Vue allows us to roll HTML/CSS/JS all into a single file, which is perfect for a single page app that just does a simplistic function. Please note that the free tier of Bitly's API only allows up to 20 link shortening returns a day!

## How to Run Locally
Download the files or clone the root folder from Github.  Run "npm install" in the terminal of your choice at the root folder.  Then run "npm run serve" to get the server up and running on a local port.  Your terminal will instruct you as to what port it's running on and will typically make it easy to direct you straight there.
